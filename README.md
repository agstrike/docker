# docker-compose examples

You can find example compose files for deploying SilverStrike. `demo` contains the stack used for the demo deployment at demo.silverstrike.org.

The `production` stack is an example stack using sqlite, which should be more than enough for your needs.
If you'd rather use postgres or mariadb, there are example for using them.
